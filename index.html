          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>With the decrease in the number of families spending time with their ageing parents and the increasing number of seniors needing help to continue with their daily necessities, there exists an ongoing problem to provide older adults the capability to obtain critical physical, mental, and social services.</p>
          <p>The high number of seniors' death during the COVID-19 pandemic was one indicator that demonstrated the urgent need of finding alternatives to help these vulnerable people that are usually forgotten by the rest of the population.  According to Statistics Canada, an estimated 16,333 excess deaths happened during COVID-19 pandemic. Out of this total number, 11,386 were older adults, 65 years old and above. The necessity to isolate the older population without having any type of technical assistance to maintain their mental and physical health was a major contributor that increased their mortality rate during COVID-19 [1]. Furthermore, finding a solution to help them survive in normal and extraordinary circumstances is crucial.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cd-subsection">
          <h2>The Problem</h2>
          <p>Many seniors are currently living in nursing homes or alone in their own homes rarely being visited by their family or friends. Having personal caregivers that can support seniors daily and all the time can help them with their needs; however, the issue is that it is not always possible. Some are unable to have private caregivers due to financial limitations and others simply don't have access to public services of this type; largely because the public medical system is overloaded and can't properly provide these services to even the most urgent cases. This creates a vulnerable situation to an already vulnerable population - increasing mortality rates, and at the same time leaving older adults voiceless. </p>
          <p>Such scenarios create a depressive atmosphere for seniors, making them feel very lonely while also suffering some mental/psychological disorders that make them unable to take care of themselves physically resulting in forgetten medications, meals, or exercise. Forgetfulness is another issue by itself where no matter how many times the caretaker reminds the person of some activity, because of reduced cognition, they still forget. It's not always possible to observe and remind them all the time and therefore by forgetting to take the medications they need, they end up worse physically and medically, sometimes even resulting in mortality. On the other hand, physical limitations hamper their ability to follow up regularly with their medical professionals, thus being unable to obtain proper medical advice for their current condition.</p>
          <p>Currently, there are not many technological tools or apps that might be available to assist these seniors with any help they might need. Above all, the most dangerous situations are in fact the scenarios where the seniors are very sick or have an accident in their own home and are unable to contact emergency services or anyone, for that matter, for urgent care. These situations, unfortunately, prevent early medical intervention, putting them at an even worse health condition. That being said, The main three user problems we aim to solve with our design are loneliness, forgetfulness and inactive physical and mental state that makes them unhealthy. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cd-subsection">
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>With more and more seniors slowly adapting to technology whether they like it or not, designing a mobile app as part of our project was found to be the best strategy to assist a larger population. Not only does this allow them to do the things they want to do, i.e. contact family, but it also provides them a tool with which to resolved the problems previously mentioned.</p>
          <p>Our mobile app, Adora, will first and foremost, allow the user to contact the people important to them, e.g. family and friends. We do this easily by creating a tiled list of frequent contacts, allowing the user to quickly recognize the person they wish to call.</p>
          <p>More importantly, Adora is used to solve the problems of loneliness, forgetfulness, and inactivity.</p>
          <p>To combat loneliness, other than being able to contact family, the app also allows the user to connect with medical professionals, social workers, and volunteers. When a user wants to talk to someone because they feel lonely and there is no one available to talk to, they can easily talk to volunteers and social workers who have provided their time to simply chat with the user. Should they need to talk to a medical professional, they can simply book an appointment with a click of a button. Should they need someone to translate for them at a doctor's appointment, they can do that too. Should they need mobility instance to take them to an appointment, such as if they're handicapped, they can do that too. Or should they just need someone to take them out to a walk in the park, the app allows for such services. Most importantly, however, should they be in an emergency they can navigate to emergency services to allow the app to contact 911, for example, for them. All of this can be done in at most 3 clicks for easy navigability.</p>
          <p>To resolve the issue of forgetfulness, the app uses a reminder feature that alerts users to frequent activities of daily living. These activities include anything as mundane as taking medications, reminding one to eat, or alerting on to a scheduled medical appointment. The app also allows pharmacists some level of control over the quantity of medications the patient has left in order to timely order refills. This relieves the user of additional cognitive load by having to remember numerous activities throughout the day.</p>
          <p>To foster a more active lifestyle, the app uses that same reminder feature to prompt the user to perform daily physical and mental exercises. Because of an older adult's reduced energy and activity levels, they are highly prone to a sedentary lifestyle, which in itself is not healthy. By reminding the user to get up and move or solve some puzzles, this helps to stretch their muscles and jog their brain activity, improving both physical and mental health.</p>
          <p>The app allows users to have access to a wide variety of resources and people to ask for help or advice on some medical issues. Other than the app offering entertainment options such as a friendly chat, users are also given the option to request for other ancillary services, e.g. translation or mobility services. Furthermore, the app provides the ability for caregivers to perform wellness checks where patients who are called do not answer, this will automatically alert social services or hospital staff to a potentially urgent situation. In such situations, the app can alert family members to what's going on allowing them to check up on the patient too.</p>
          <p>Since the user experience is an important factor and the goal is to address issues of the most vulnerable ones, our app takes into consideration seniors who have visual impairments.  The app will allow them to talk and by speech recognition technology in connection with Siri, the app will still be able to listen to all the instructions or requests of the user and complete them. This can also be useful in dangerous situations mentioned earlier if the user had an accident and they are not in the power of being able to type and click on the buttons in the app to call 911 emergencies. All these factors will contribute a lot to keeping them not only mentally and physically healthy but first alive in critical situations.</p>
          <p>For UI/UX design, it has been taken into consideration that the target population is older adults. That is to say, a very simple, straightforward, intuitive design is implemented. </p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>Since the project concerns mostly older adults (above 65+ years old), the attention, for the purpose of this project, was shifted to focus on old people only. The participants were decided to be of different seniors ages (between 65-94 years old). All participants are chosen to be from Montreal, Quebec since it will be the first place that the app will be launched and used. Another reason that participants were chosen from Montreal is the fact that the city is a multicultural mosaic. There is a high cultural variety in Montreal that helps us avoid bias towards certain cultures over others. Furthermore, the users all have very different cultural backgrounds with different religions and races. All participants are well-enabled to make an informed and voluntary decision about accepting or not accepting to partake in the study. They have been informed about the purpose of the study, details about the research, and have been asked to give their consent. Users are perfectly linked to personas and user journey map representations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cd-subsection">
        <h2>The Survey</h2>
        <p>To better design the app, it was important to understand the current needs and frustrations of our target population. Thus, a survey was conducted to collect information about our users. Only seniors of age 65 and above participated in the survey and they were all made aware and accepted the ethical considerations of the survey. The survey was delivered from January to February, 2023, with a total number of 28 respondents.</p>
        <p>The main goal of the survey was to estimate the current percentage of seniors that use apps to help them maintain wellness of their physical and mental health. In addition, the survey was also focused on understanding how necessary it is to provide services to seniors through an app to avoid severe medical consequences. Finally, through this survey, it was important to understand the extent to which having an app will solve daily issues that seniors encounter to keep their physical and mental state healthy. Results confirm that such an app is essential to help this vulnerable population with their everyday needs.</p>
        <p>According to survey, 96.4% of older adults do not use any app to keep their physical and mental state healthy.</p>

          <h2>Style Guide</h2>
          <p>While considering the style guide, the user experience and usability goals are taken into consideration. More focus is given on learnability and memorability since the target population is old and the decline in their cognitive abilities affects the learning curve negatively. The app is designed in a way that even if the user has never used a phone, they will still be able to use the app as long as they speak/read English. Without the need for instruction or explanation, they will intuitively be able to access the service they are looking for. The visual elements, such as buttons, font faces, and font sizes are carefully chosen in order to cater to the user and let them enjoy the experience while navigating through the app. The number of buttons is intentionally chosen to be minimal per page to avoid confusion to the user, have a clear set of options, and a less crowded screen. Every element in the design, images used, colors and dimensions are chosen to create a cohesive and consistent design throughout all the pages. Efficiency, user experience goals, and usability criteria are all measured to enhance customer satisfaction. Overall, the app, with all of its characteristics, is designed in a way that will allow the user to have a rewarding, unique, and enjoyable experience. Each individual design element will be discussed more in detail in the following sections.

          <p>There is no particular color appropriate for older adults [7]. Rather, what is important is that colors chosen in designing an application have a high contrast. The high contrast provides high distinguishability especially in older adults with deteriorating vision, i.e. presbyopia (age-related nearsightedness). In particular, according to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, a contrast ratio of 1:8 is needed to achieve a AAA rating, the highest possible rating [8]. This color palette was chosen because it has at minimum, a contrast ratio of 1:8, and at most, a contrast ratio of 1:12.</p>

          <h2>Typography</h2>
          <p>The chosen fonts are Montserrat, for headings, and Open Sans, for paragraphs and captions. These are both sans-serif fonts with high legibility - how a typeface's glyphs can be correctly identified as character and words, including how individual characters can be distinguished from one another[6]. These fonts are also used in this report.</p>
          <p>These two fonts were specifically chosen as serif fonts have been found to be easier to read and less tiring among English readers[7].</p>
          <p>A sample of how these two fonts work together, taken from a sample website, is shown below.</p>

          <h2>Icons and Illustrations</h2>
          <p>Because of reduced cognition and perception, older adults may have difficulty when distinguishing numerous icons of different designs. Thus, the decision to use consistent and simple iconography was put forward to improve usability for older adults[7]. This is the reason why the menus were designed to be icon-based rather than text-based. This allows the user to quickly navigate between the application's features without having to comprehend text-based menus, by using an intuitive icon-based design. Moreover, the icons themselves are accompanied by simple, self-explanatory text that tells the user the destination of his menu choice. The following icons are used in the application to help navigate between areas.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In conclusion, the Adora app provides a potential solution for the challenges faced by seniors in accessing critical physical, mental, and social services. The app aims to address issues of loneliness, forgetfulness, and inactive physical and mental states that can make seniors unhealthy. The app offers a range of features that help users connect with their families, caregivers, social workers, and volunteers, as well as remind them to take their medication, eat on time, and exercise. Additionally, the app can send automatic alerts and text messages in emergency situations, making it easier for seniors to access urgent assistance when needed. The app's design takes into account the specific needs of seniors and is easy to use with a straightforward, intuitive design. For example, the app will have large, legible text and buttons, with clear icons and visual cues to aid navigation. Additionally, the color scheme is carefully chosen to promote readability and contrast, taking into consideration the visual impairments that some users may have. By providing a comprehensive solution, the Adora app can help seniors live healthier and more fulfilling lives, even when they are unable to access traditional healthcare services.
